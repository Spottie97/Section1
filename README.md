# Three.js--Hello_Cube
# Udemy Course for Three.js
I would highly recommend you purchase the course if you want to learn how to code in Three.js, its covers all the basics you require. I had a very limited knowledge of JavaScirpt, HTML and CSS and I can tell you its very easy to follow along. I left the link to the course below.
